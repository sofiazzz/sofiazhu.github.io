## Background

After university, I have completely moved to be a Java guy and it has been four years since then. As I found some fun stuffs in Computer Graphics recently which replies so much on Cpp, I think I should pick up everything I dropped to consolidate the foundation and continue my study on Computer Graphics. This is a series to review Cpp as a Java developer following [The Cherno]().

## Cpp Compiler

Cpp compiler just convert codes into **constant data and machine code**, which are the .obj files. While in Java, codes are converted into bytecodes, which are .class files. Bytecodes cannot be understand by machine however, they will be converted again to become machine code by just-in-time (JIT) compiler in JVM during runtime.

It can be very helpful to check the pre-processing files through Visual Studio and learn if your code is of high quality from machine codes.
